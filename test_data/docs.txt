THE ALLIES AFTER NASSAU IN DECEMBER 1960, THE U.S . FIRST

PROPOSED TO HELP NATO DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE . BUT EUROPE

MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEVISE A PLAN . LAST WEEK, AS THEY STUDIED THE

NASSAU ACCORD BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN,

EUROPEANS SAW EMERGING THE FIRST OUTLINES OF THE NUCLEAR NATO THAT THE

U.S . WANTS AND WILL SUPPORT . IT ALL SPRANG FROM THE ANGLO-U.S .

CRISIS OVER CANCELLATION OF THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT MISSILE, AND THE

U.S . OFFER TO SUPPLY BRITAIN AND FRANCE WITH THE PROVED POLARIS (TIME,

DEC . 28) . THE ONE ALLIED LEADER WHO UNRESERVEDLY WELCOMED THE POLARIS

OFFER WAS HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO BY THUS KEEPING A SEPARATE NUCLEAR

DETERRENT FOR BRITAIN HAD SAVED HIS OWN NECK . BACK FROM NASSAU, THE

PRIME MINISTER BEAMED THAT BRITAIN NOW HAD A WEAPON THAT " WILL LAST A

GENERATION . THE TERMS ARE VERY GOOD . " MANY OTHER BRITONS WERE NOT SO

SURE . THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHOULDER NONE OF THE $800 MILLION

DEVELOPMENT COST OF POLARIS, IT HAS ALREADY POURED $28 MILLION INTO

SKYBOLT AND WILL HAVE TO SPEND PERHAPS $1 BILLION MORE FOR A FLEET OF

MISSILE-PACKING SUBMARINES . AT BEST, THE BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

DESIGN, BUILD AND PROVE ITS NUCLEAR FLEET BEFORE 1970, THREE YEARS

AFTER BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE HAS PRESUMABLY BECOME OBSOLETE . THEN WHAT

? TORY BACKBENCHERS ARE LOUDLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THEY CALL " THE

SMALL TYPE " IN THE NASSAU PACT, WHICH STIPULATES THAT BRITAIN'S

POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, EXCEPT WHEN " SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS "

INTERVENE, MUST BE COMMITTED TO A TRULY MULTILATERAL NATO FORCE . DOES

THAT MEAN THAT BRITAIN WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE NO STRIKE FORCE OF ITS OWN

? WHO WILL DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFY

WITHDRAWAL OF SUBMARINES FROM NATO, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE NATIONAL

INTERESTS CONFLICT WITH U.S . POLICY ? THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL IS

WHETHER FRANCE'S INCLUSION IN THE OFFER WAS A DELIBERATE PLOY BY JACK

KENNEDY TO END OR AT LEAST DOWNGRADE BRITAIN'S PRIZED " SPECIAL

RELATIONSHIP " WITH THE U.S . THE CARTOONISTS WENT EVEN FARTHER . THEY

NOT ONLY SHOWED SUPERMAC JUMPING TO SUPERJACK'S COMMANDS, BUT DE GAULLE

AND ADENAUER AS WELL . AS EDITH SAID . THE FRENCH, WHO GOT NO HELP FROM

THE U.S . IN DEVELOPING THEIR FORCE DE FRAPPE, WERE QUICK TO CROW THAT

BRITAIN'S VAUNTED TIES WITH THE U.S . HAD BROUGHT IT NOTHING BUT

HUMILIATION . BY CONTRAST, BRAGGED FRENCH OFFICIALS, THE SKYBOLT FIASCO

ONLY VINDICATED FRANCE'S DECISION TO DEVELOP ITS OWN BOMBS AND DELIVERY

SYSTEMS . THUS, THOUGH CHARLES DE GAULLE PROMISED TO " REFLECT " ON THE

POLARIS OFFER, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ANY

OFFER THAT WOULD SUBJECT A FRENCH FORCE TO ALLIED CONTROL . IT IS DE

GAULLE'S UNSWERVING CONVICTION THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY TO

INVADE WESTERN EUROPE, NO NATION THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTACKED MEANING

THE U.S . WOULD INVITE NUCLEAR DEVASTATION BY HELPING ITS ALLIES . THUS

UNLIKE BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE, WHICH ALL ALONG HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO "

THE WESTERN STRATEGIC DETERRENT, " FRANCE'S FORCE DE FRAPPE WILL BE

RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR FRANCE'S DEFENSE . AT THE SAME TIME, DE GAULLE HAS

LONG ARGUED THAT THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE COULD BE RUN MOST EFFICIENTLY BY

A TRIUMVIRATE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRANCE AS AN EQUAL OF THE U.S . AND

BRITAIN . THIS IS ONE OF HIS MAJOR, IF UNSPOKEN, CONDITIONS FOR BRITISH

MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET ; AND DE GAULLE SUGGESTED POINTEDLY TO

MACMILLAN THAT IT WOULD HELP IF BRITAIN WERE TO SHARE ITS ADVANCED

MISSILE TECHNOLOGY WITH FRANCE . WHEN MACMILLAN REPLIED NONCOMMITTALLY

THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH KENNEDY, DE GAULLE TOLD HIS

GUEST WITH HAUTEUR THAT FRANCE IN THAT CASE COULD DO NOTHING TO EASE

BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO EUROPE . GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR . KONRAD ADENAUER,

ON THE OTHER HAND, IS FEARFUL THAT DE GAULLE WILL SNAP UP THE POLARIS

OFFER AND IN THIS WAY ACHIEVE HIS GOAL OF A THREE-NATION NATO

DIRECTORATE . THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT VOWED IN 1954 NOT TO MANUFACTURE

NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ADENAUER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE THAT

WITHOUT THEM, AND WITH NO SAY IN THEIR USE, WEST GERMANY WILL BE

RELEGATED TO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE . LAST WEEK AN

OFFICIAL BULLETIN EVEN REVIVED THE OLD, BITTER CRY THAT U.S . PLEAS FOR

GREATER RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES ARE AIMED AT RAISING GERMAN "

CANNON FODDER " FOR U.S . " ATOMIC KNIGHTS . " A FROSTY LETTER FROM THE

CHANCELLOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY, WHICH ALREADY

SUPPLIES ALMOST 50 PER CENT OF NATO GROUND STRENGTH, DOES NOT INTEND TO

RAISE ANY MORE DIVISIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL WARFARE . YET U.S . STRATEGIC

PLANNERS REASON THAT THE ONLY CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO SOVIET ATTACK IS A

STRONG ARMY ON THE GROUND, BACKED BY THE VAST U.S . NUCLEAR ARSENAL .

FACT IS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD NEVER BE USED

INDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S . AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT INVITING DEVASTATING

SOVIET RETALIATION . AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH

WILL HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A NUCLEAR CAPACITY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 4

PER CENT OF U.S . NUCLEAR POWER . " IT IS JUST A DAMNED NUISANCE, "

SAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAST WEEK . " IT MEANS NOTHING

MILITARILY EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BAIL OUT THE FIRST

COUNTRY THAT THROWS THE FIRST PEA AT THE RUSSIANS OR ANYONE ELSE . "

CHARLES DE GAULLE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO AGREE, AT LEAST UNTIL HIS

FORCE DE FRAPPE BECOMES OBSOLETE . FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY, THE

MULTILATERAL DETERRENT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE . EVENTUALLY, FRANCE, TOO,

MAY WELL FIND A NATO-CONTROLLED POLARIS FLEET, OR ITS POSSIBLE

SUCCESSOR, A EUROPEAN MINUTEMAN ARSENAL, THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE

SPIRALING COST AND DIMINISHING VALUE OF GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR .

RUSSIA WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE ? IT WAS IN 1954 THAT NIKITA

KHRUSHCHEV LAUNCHED HIS GRANDIOSE " VIRGIN LANDS " GAMBLE . PART OF THE

PLAN WAS TO PLOW UP 32 MILLION ACRES OF MARGINAL LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN,

AND SETTLE IT WITH COMMUNIST " PIONEERS, " WHO WERE TO PLANT AND

PRODUCE HUGE QUANTITIES OF DESPERATELY NEEDED GRAIN WITHIN TWO YEARS .

NIKITA'S SCHEME FLOPPED . THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH RAINFALL, AND THE

PIONEERS DID NOT TAKE TO TRACTOR LIFE ON THE BLEAK FRONTIER . EXCEPT

FOR 1958, EACH HARVEST HAS BEEN LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S . WORST

YEAR OF ALL WAS 1962, WHEN THE VIRGIN LANDS DELIVERED ONLY HALF THEIR

QUOTAS . NATURALLY, KHRUSHCHEV TAKES NONE OF THE BLAME FOR THE FIASCO .

THREE YEARS AGO HE FOUND A SCAPEGOAT IN KAZAKHSTAN PARTY BOSS NIKOLAI

BELYAEV, FIRED HIM FOR HIS " ERRORS . " LAST WEEK BELYAEV'S SUCCESSOR,

DINMUKHAMED KUNAEV, WAS SIMILARLY BOUNCED FOR " LAPSES " IN HIS WORK .

FOR GOOD MEASURE, MOSCOW ALSO PURGED THE FORMER PREMIER OF THE

TERRITORY FROM THE LOCAL PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE . IT WAS PERHAPS NO

COINCIDENCE THAT NIKOLAI IGNATOV, 61, A ONETIME KHRUSHCHEV CRONY, LAST

WEEK ABRUPTLY LEFT HIS POST AS A SOVIET DEPUTY PREMIER AFTER ONLY NINE

MONTHS ON THE JOB . FARM EXPERT IGNATOV HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE BOSS

OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO BOOST FOOD PRODUCTION .

BERLIN ONE LAST RUN HANS WEIDNER HAD BEEN HOPING FOR MONTHS TO

ESCAPE DRAB EAST GERMANY AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE WEST . THE ODDS WERE

AGAINST HIM, FOR WEIDNER, 40, WAS A CRIPPLE ON CRUTCHES WHO LIVED IN

THE VILLAGE OF NEUGERSDORF, 115 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FRONTIER OF

FREEDOM BUT HANS WEIDNER DID HAVE ONE MAJOR ASSET, THE BUS THAT

HE OPERATED FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNIST REGIME . IT WAS AN UGLY THING, AND

ANCIENT . ITS CHASSIS CREAKED, AND THE ENGINE COUGHED ; A

CREAM-COLORED COAT OF PAINT COULD NOT DISGUISE THE WELTS AND BRUISES OF

TWO DECADES OF CHUGGING SERVICE . IN FACT, THE BUS WAS READY FOR THE

JUNK PILE WHEN WEIDNER DECIDED TO PRESS IT INTO SERVICE FOR ONE LAST

RUN . SHARP BLADES . THE HAZARDS WOULD BE GREAT ON THE JOURNEY TO THE

BORDER ; SO WEIDNER SIGNED UP A FELLOW VILLAGER, JURGEN WAGNER, 22, TO

TAKE THE WHEEL . EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE PAIR BEGAN THE

FEVERISH PREPARATIONS IN WEIDNER'S GARAGE . FIRST WEIDNER AND WAGNER

ATTACHED A HEAVY SNOWPLOW TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS, NOT TO PLOW SNOW,

BUT TO SCOOP AWAY THE HEAVY OBSTACLES THEY KNEW AWAITED THEM AT

ROADBLOCKS AHEAD . TO ALL SIX LUGS ON EACH FRONT WHEEL THEY BOLTED

SHARP BLADES OF THE TOUGHEST STEEL, AFFIXED SO THAT THE WHIRLING EDGES

WOULD CHOP BARBED WIRE TO BITS . THEN THEY WEDGED ONE-QUARTER-INCH

SECTIONS OF STEEL PLATE INSIDE THE BUS TO STOP BULLETS . AT LAST ALL

WAS READY . ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WEIDNER AND WAGNER PILED THEIR WIVES AND

FOUR CHILDREN ABOARD, NOT FORGETTING THREE TONS OF HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS

. FOR ADDED PROTECTION THE PLOTTERS SHOVELED A TON OF COAL AND POTATOES

INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS . THEN THEY CHUGGED OFF NORTH TOWARD BERLIN

ALONG BACK ROADS TO ESCAPE COMMUNIST PATROLS . JUST BEFORE THEY REACHED

THE WALL, THEY PLANNED TO SWING WEST IN ORDER TO ENTER THE EAST-WEST

AUTOBAHN LEADING TO THE U.S . SECTOR OF THE CITY . EN ROUTE, THE

RADIATOR FROZE IN THE SUBZERO WEATHER . THAT FIXED, THEY WERE ONLY A

FEW MILES FARTHER WHEN A TIRE BLEW OUT . THE KIDS WERE CRYING AND THE

WIVES SHIVERING WITH COLD AND PANIC WHEN, AT LAST, THEY ARRIVED AT

DREWITZ, THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED CHECKPOINT ON THE ENTIRE AUTOBAHN TO

BERLIN . IT WAS NO TIME TO STOP AND RECONSIDER . FLYING POTATOES . "

WAH-AH, WAH-AH, " SHRIEKED THE POLICE-TYPE KLAXONS THAT WEIDNER HAD

THOUGHTFULLY INSTALLED IN ADVANCE . THE COMMUNIST GUARDS OBEDIENTLY

RAISED THE FIRST OF THREE BARRIERS . BUT WHAT WAS A BUS DOING ON

EMERGENCY DUTY ? SUDDENLY THE SHOOTING BEGAN TOO LATE . WAGNER, AT 40

M.P.H., WAS ALREADY CRASHING THROUGH THE SECOND BARRIER 100 YARDS

AHEAD, THEN THE THIRD, ONLY 20 YARDS AWAY . ITS WINDSHIELD SMASHED, ITS

PASSENGERS SHAKEN, ITS CARGO OF COAL AND POTATOES IN EVERY CORNER OF

THE CAB, THE OLD BUS FINALLY LURCHED TO A STOP A FEW MILES DOWN THE

ROAD WHERE THE COMMUNISTS NO LONGER MATTERED AT THE U.S . CHECKPOINT, A

FOOT OR TWO INSIDE WEST BERLIN .

THE ROAD TO JAIL IS PAVED WITH NONOBJECTIVE ART SINCE THE

KREMLIN'S SHARPEST BARBS THESE DAYS ARE AIMED AT MODERN ART AND "

WESTERN ESPIONAGE, " IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE KGB'S COPS

WOULD TURN UP A VICTIM WHOSE WRONGDOINGS COMBINED BOTH EVILS . HE

TURNED OUT TO BE A LENINGRAD PHYSICS TEACHER WHOSE TASTE FOR ABSTRACT

PAINTING ALLEGEDLY LED HIM TO JOIN THE U.S . SPY SERVICE . POLICE SAID

THEY FIRST SPOTTED THE TEACHER, ONE RUDOLF FRIEDMAN, AS HE MUTTERED

UNCOMPLIMENTARY REMARKS ABOUT SOCIALIST REALISM WHILE STROLLING THROUGH

LENINGRAD'S RUSSIAN MUSEUM . A WELL-DRESSED U.S . TOURIST APPROACHED

HIM, ENTHUSIASTICALLY SHARED HIS SENTIMENTS, AND PROMISED TO SEND

FRIEDMAN REPRODUCTIONS OF AVANT-GARDE PAINTINGS FROM AMERICA . THE

PICTURE FRIEDMAN LIKED BEST, SAID THE COPS INDIGNANTLY, WAS A " CHAOS

OF BLACK, RED AND BLUE SPLOTCHES CAPTIONED I NEED YOU TONIGHT . " SOON,

THEY SAID, THE TEACHER WAS GETTING MESSAGES FROM THE U.S . WRITTEN IN

INVISIBLE INK . JUST AS FRIEDMAN PREPARED TO DELIVER INFORMATION " VERY

REMOTE FROM THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT ABSTRACT ART, " POLICEMOVED IN

AND HUSTLED HIM OFF TO JAIL .

THE CONGO ROUND 3 ? THE SOUND OF

CHRISTMAS IN KATANGA PROVINCE WAS THE THUNK OF MORTAR SHELLS AND THE

RATTLE OF MACHINE GUNS . AFTER AN UNEASY TWELVE-MONTH TRUCE BETWEEN U.N

. FORCES AND THE TROOPS OF KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE, A FEW

MINOR INCIDENTS GOT OUT OF HAND, AND FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER

1961 THE PROVINCE WAS IN TURMOIL . BLUE-HELMETED U.N . SOLDIERS SWARMED

THROUGH ELISABETHVILLE, SEIZED ROADBLOCKS ON THE HIGHWAYS . SWEDISH U.N

. SAAB JETS SWOOPED LOW OVER KATANGA'S AIRFIELD AT KOLWEZI, DESTROYING

FOUR PLANES ON THE GROUND AND SETTING OIL TANKS ABLAZE . IN THE FIRST

SKIRMISHES, SEVEN U.N . SOLDIERS WERE DEAD . THE FIGHTING BEGAN WITH

WHAT ELISABETHVILLE RESIDENTS CALL " L'AFFAIRE SIMBA " A REFERENCE TO

SIMBA BEER, THE LOCAL BREW THAT BOTH SIDES GUZZLED ON AND OFF DUTY . AS

THE U.N . TOLD IT, BOOZED-UP KATANGESE GENDARMES SUDDENLY OPENED FIRE

ON A DETACHMENT OF ETHIOPIAN U.N . TROOPS IN SUBURBAN LUBUMBASHI . AS

TSHOMBE DESCRIBED MATTERS, A FEW TIPSY ETHIOPIANS STARTED THE SHOOTING

BY SCRAMBLING ATOP A 200-FT . SLAG HEAP OUTSIDE THE BIG UNION MINIERE

PLANT AND TAKING POTSHOTS AT THE KATANGESE . FIREWORKS NEXT . IN ANY

CASE, KATANGESE SOLDIERS AT A GOLF COURSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF

ELISABETHVILLE TOOK THE OCCASION TO SHOOT DOWN AN UNARMED U.N .

HELICOPTER MOVING OVERHEAD . THEY STONED THE SIX SURVIVING CREWMEN,

PUMMELED THEM WITH RIFLE BUTTS ; A 23-YEAR-OLD SIKH LIEUTENANT, WHO

LAY HELPLESS WITH A MACHINE GUN SLUG IN THE ABDOMEN, DIED UNATTENDED IN

THREE HOURS . INDIAN BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, COMMANDER OF U.N .

TROOPS IN KATANGA'S CAPITAL, WAS FURIOUS THIS IS THE LAST TIME, HE SAID

. " NEXT TIME THERE ARE GOING TO BE FIREWORKS . " NORONHA DID NOT HAVE

LONG TO WAIT . THREE DAYS LATER AN ETHIOPIAN GUARD FIRED A WARNING SHOT

AT A KATANGESE SOLDIER WHO WAS APPROACHING HIS POST . UNHURT, THE

KATANGESE ROLLED DOWN A HILL IN SEARCH OF COVER, BUT HIS COMRADES

THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN HIT AND OPENED FIRE . SOON U.N . POSITIONS AROUND

THE CITY WERE UNDER ATTACK . TSHOMBE " AGREED " TO A CEASE-FIRE, BUT

HIS 20,000 MEN KEPT RIGHT ON FIGHTING . " THEY ARE MAD, " SAID A RED

CROSS OFFICIAL WHO SAW THEM RAMPAGING THROUGH A TOWNSHIP, FIRING AT

ANYTHING THAT MOVED . " THEY ARE KILLING THEIR OWN MEN . " THE U.N .

CLAIMED TSHOMBE HAD LOST CONTROL OF HIS MEN WHICH GAVE IT AN EXCUSE TO

STRIKE BACK . FROM MANHATTAN U.N . HEADQUARTERS, ORDERS WERE FLASHED TO

THE 12,000-MAN U.N . FORCE IN KATANGA : " TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTION IN

SELF-DEFENSE AND TO RESTORE ORDER . " SPEARHEADED BY 5,700 TOUGH,

BITTER GURKHAS, THE U.N . FORCE METHODICALLY SWEPT DISORGANIZED

KATANGESE TROOPS FROM THEIR GUARDPOSTS ON THE ROAD TO NORTHERN RHODESIA

. POWER LINES FELL IN THE FRAY, LEAVING SHABBY LITTLE ELISABETHVILLE

(POP . 180,000) WITHOUT LIGHT, WATER OR PHONES .

SPEARS & ARROWS . NORONHA DEMANDED ONCE MORE

THAT TSHOMBE CALL A CEASEFIRE, WARNED THAT UNLESS HE COMPLIED IN 30

MINUTES, " A GENERAL WAR WILL BEGIN . " TSHOMBE REJECTED THE ULTIMATUM,

AND THE U.N . WENT OVER TO AN ALL-OUT AIR AND GROUND OFFENSIVE . THE

INDIAN BRIGADE STORMED AND CAPTURED THE HEADQUARTERS OF KATANGA'S

GENDARMERIE AT KARAVIA, A MILE FROM ELISABETHVILLE, WITH LITTLE

RESISTANCE . ANOTHER COLUMN OF TROOPS ADVANCED NORTHWEST TOWARD

JADOTVILLE, IN THE HEART OF THE COPPER BELT THAT GIVES TSHOMBE $40

MILLION A YEAR IN REVENUES . U.N . FORCES ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD TAKEN

OVER ELISABETHVILLE'S POST OFFICE, RADIO STATION AND RAILWAY DEPOT AND

HAD OCCUPIED TSHOMBE'S PALACE . AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOOTING, TSHOMBE

VANISHED INTO HIDING, BUT HE WAS NOT CALLING IT QUITS . " EVERYWHERE,

THE U.N . AND ITS TROOPS WILL BE FOUGHT WITH TRAPS, WITH POISONED

ARROWS AND SPEARS, " HE SAID IN AN ANGRY STATEMENT THROUGH ONE OF HIS

AIDES . " WE WILL RESIST BY ALL MEANS, INCLUDING THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION

OF ALL OUR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL . " WAS THIS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN IN THE

U.N.'S 2F-YEAR ATTEMPT TO END KATANGA'S SECESSION FROM THE CONGO ?

U.N . SPOKESMEN INSISTED THAT IT WAS NOT, BUT SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT

SAYS HE IS CONVINCED THAT UNLESS TSHOMBE IS SUBDUED SOON, PREMIER

CYRILLE ADOULA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEOPOLDVILLE WILL COLLAPSE . THE

U.S . AGREES, AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY HAS BEEN TALKING UP THE

IMMINENT DANGER OF A LEFTIST, SOVIET-BACKED TAKEOVER IN LEOPOLDVILLE .

BUT THE BRITISH, WHO SEE KATANGA AS A STABLE BUFFER FOR THE RHODESIAS,

WARNED AGAINST THE " FUTILITY OF TRYING TO IMPOSE A POLITICAL

SETTLEMENT BY FORCE . " THE FRENCH, WHO, LIKE THE BRITISH, HAVE HEAVY

INVESTMENTS IN THE UNION MINIERE, WANT HANDS OFF, AND IN BRUSSELS, 200

BELGIANS DEMONSTRATED THEIR FEELINGS BY MARCHING ON THE U.S . EMBASSY

SHOUTING, " DOWN WITH KENNEDY !

TUNISIA DOUBLE JEOPARDY AS A DEDICATED TUNISIAN NATIONALIST,

PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, IS A POPULAR HERO TO MOST OF THE

MILLIONS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED HIM SINCE INDEPENDENCE WAS WON IN 1956 . BUT

BOURGUIBA ALSO HAS HIS DEADLY ENEMIES . LAST WEEK A DETERMINED GROUP OF

THE LATTER ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN ASSASSINATING TUNISIA'S STOCKY

CHIEFTAIN . THE PLOTTERS ACTUALLY MADE TWO ATTEMPTS ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE

. THE FIRST TRY FAILED ON DEC . 15 BECAUSE BOURGUIBA DID NOT SPEND THE

NIGHT AT HIS PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT CARTHAGE, NEAR TUNIS . THE PLOTTERS

NEXT LAID THEIR PLANS FOR MIDNIGHT, DEC . 21, AND EVEN BOURGUIBA'S

PERSONAL BODYGUARD AGREED TO LEAD THE KILLERS TO THE PRESIDENT'S

BEDSIDE . NO REPLACEMENT . A FEW HOURS BEFORE MIDNIGHT, A TUNISIAN ARMY

NON-COM BURST IN UPON A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND BLURTED THE

DETAILS OF THE PLOT . THAT NIGHT, AND ON FOLLOWING DAYS, MORE THAN A

HUNDRED PLOTTERS WERE JAILED . THEY PROVED TO BE A HANDFUL OF DISSIDENT

ARMY OFFICERS AND SOME DISGRUNTLED LANDOWNERS . BUT THE HARD CORE

SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTERS OF BOURGUIBA'S OLD FOE, THE LATE SALAH BEN

YOUSSEF, WHO LOST A BITTER STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF NEO-DESTOUR,

TUNISIA'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY, AND WENT INTO EXILE IN 1955 . WHEN BEN

YOUSSEF WAS MURDERED IN WEST GERMANY IN 1961 HIS FOLLOWERS BACK HOME

BLAMED BOURGUIBA AGENTS, SWORE VENGEANCE ON TUNISIA'S BOSS HIMSELF .

THE PLOTTERS' ONLY PLAN, APPARENTLY, WAS TO SLAY THE PRESIDENT . SAID

BOURGUIBA : " AFTER MY DEATH THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF

TOTAL ANARCHY . THE PLOTTERS THOUGHT ONLY OF ELIMINATING ME, NOT

REPLACING ME . " CROWDS GATHERED TO HEAR OFFICIAL SPEECHES OF

INDIGNATION AT THE ATTEMPT ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE . THERE SEEMED LITTLE

DOUBT THAT HE STILL HELD THE NATION'S BASIC LOYALTY, BUT EVEN HIS

CLOSEST FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED AT THE RECENT SIGNS OF UNREST CAUSED BY

THREE SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND AN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL OF 400,000

OUT OF A POPULATIONS OF 4,000,000 . BOURGUIBA IS ALSO AWARE OF THE

MUTTERING OF MANY ABOUT THE THREE EXPENSIVE NEW PALACES HE HAS RECENTLY

BUILT . THESE " BELONG TO THE STATE, " HE RETORTED IN HIS " I AM ALIVE

/ SPEECH . HE ADDED WITH SOME BITTERNESS : " THERE IS A TENDENCY TO

FORGET THAT I SPENT 30 YEARS IN FRENCH JAILS FOR MY COUNTRY . " KNOCKED

HEADS . IN HIS EFFORTS TO RESHAPE TUNISIA AS A MODERN NATION, BOURGUIBA

HAS HAD TO KNOCK HEADS TOGETHER . INEVITABLY, SOME ARMY OFFICERS RESENT

THE BACKSEAT ROLE HE GIVES THE MILITARY . AND MOSLEM RELIGIOUS LEADERS

ARE ANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH THE DAY-LONG FASTS OF THE MONTH

OF RAMADAN, AND BY HIS EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN . A U.S .INVESTIGATING

COMMITTEE IN 1961 AGREED THAT BOURGUIBA WAS MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES TO

SOLVE TUNIS'S ECONOMIC ILLS, BUT WARNED THAT HE MIGHT BE ASKING TOO

GREAT SACRIFICES OF HIS PEOPLE . AFTER LAST WEEK'S BRUSH WITH DEATH,

BOURGUIBA MAY GO FORWARD A BIT MORE SLOWLY, AND CAN UNDOUBTEDLY DRAW

SOME SUPPORT FROM THE FACT THAT LAST MONTH THE U.S . FINALLY AGREED TO

GRANT TUNISIA $180 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS .
